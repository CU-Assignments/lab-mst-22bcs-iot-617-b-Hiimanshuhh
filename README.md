# Basic Banking System in Java

A console-based banking application that simulates core banking operations. This program allows users to create accounts, make deposits and withdrawals, and check account balances.

## Features
- Account creation with name, account number, and initial balance
- Secure deposit operations
- Withdrawal operations with overdraft prevention
- Account balance inquiry
